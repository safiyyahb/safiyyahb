I'm a clinical researcher at Stanford University with a background in neuroscience and psychology. I have experience in neuroimaging clinical research (fNIRS/fMRI), as well as clinical trial operations in the areas of medical devices and drug trials. I am looking for roles in which I can utilize my research and administrative abilities to carry out clinical operations.
