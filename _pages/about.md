I'm a neuroscience clinical researcher at Stanford University. My interest lies in using brain imaging tools (fMRI & fNIRS) to investigate clinical disorders. My hope is that this information will be used to improve clinical interventions and treatments. I am looking for roles in which I can utilize my research and administrative abilities to carry out user research, data collection and research operations.
